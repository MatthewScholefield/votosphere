# Votosphere

*A simple poll creator*

Votosphere is a simple React app useful for creating on the fly polls.
Beyond being open source, the benefit over other similar apps is that
the description field uses markdown so that it can have more advanced
formatting.

The app does not consist of a backend but rather relies exclusively on
[Blobse](https://github.com/MatthewScholefield/blobse) as a json store.
For this reason along with the app's MVP design, do not create polls
with sensitive data or that require a high level of accuracy.
